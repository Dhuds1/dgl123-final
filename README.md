My final project

## PAIN LOG
### Day 21-10-23
- 404 page wasn't working, because of my .htaccess | I have it redirecting to index, and removing the .php from the end of its URL. This coupled with some other things lead me down an HOUR LONG TROUBLE SHOOT. I created infinite loops, made all my pages have errors and overall was ready to send my laptop to the netherworld. However, I figured out my issue, and the problem with every page going to a 404 page was because of the way it called the function looking for if the page existed. Thankfully, chatGPT and I are hommies and we figured it out. Yeah, I use chatGPT ALL THE TIME. I'm not ashamed, it doesn't replace my thinking it just helps me with the mundane things, and spotting mistakes.

## SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS
- as of right now I have overly complicated logic, and no real direction that I am going. I am going to redirect my focus to work on something different entirely. For MILESTONE 3, my goal is to create a database that stores products that are related to a store front. ON the store front page, if you click on a product it will open up that product post. THAT IS ALL.
